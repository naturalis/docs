Getting started
===============

To get going you need to arrange a couple of things. Below, all necessary steps are explained in detail.


Make a Github account
---------------------

If you don't have a Github account, please `sign up for one <https://github.com/join>`_. Choose the free option.

After you've made the account, make an `ICT Support call <http://ictsupport.naturalis.nl>`_ with the request to join the Naturalis organization on Github.

All documentation projects at Naturalis are managed in separate '`repositories <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_%28version_control%29>`_' (the set of version controlled files and directories). The names of these repositories is structured as '<projectname>-docs'. You can look up and search the existing repositories on `github.com/naturalis <https://github.com/naturalis>`_. Please mention the repository you want to work at in the support call.


Choose your workflow
--------------------

As explained in the introduction there are basically two workflow options:

* Use the Github webinterface to edit files
* Use a Git client to synchronize files in the Github repository with a folder on your computer and use a local editor of choice

Both methods are explained below.

Github webinterface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the webinterface is pretty simple and might be the best option if you're not acquainted with the use of Git and just want to get started quickly:

#. First of all, `login <https://github.com/login>`_ to your Github account.
#. Go to the `Naturalis page on Github <https://github.com/naturalis>`_ and search for the repository you want to work in.

To edit an existing file follow these steps:

#. In the list of files, click on the one you want edit. For each section there will be a file with an rst-extension.
#. Click on the pencil icon on the top right to start editing. 
#. To check how the code will be rendered on Github click on the Preview tab.
#. When you're finished editing add a short description of the changes you've made under 'Commit changes' and click the button with the same name.

To add a new section follow these steps

#. In the top directory of the repository (e.g. `github.com/naturalis/nba-docs <https://github.com/naturalis/nba-docs>`_) click on the '+' icon to add a file
#. Add a name with 'rst' as extension and underscores in place of spaces (e.g. getting_started.rst)
#. Edit and commit the file as explained above.

Git client
